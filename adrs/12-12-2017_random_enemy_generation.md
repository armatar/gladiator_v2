# Create Random Enemy Generation

### Status: proposed

## Context: 

It is desirable that we have a way for enemies to be randomly generated with different statistics and abilities in order to keep combat fresh and new with an element of surprise. Creating a way to generate random enemies systematically will keep us from having to create specific new enemies.

## Decision: 

Create a random enemy factory that will pump out characters of the enemy child class.
